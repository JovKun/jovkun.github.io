This bot was initially made since a bot that did this exact same thing got taken down from the Discord bot directory, so I took it upon myself to make one on my own.

Using `discord.py` and osu!API, the bot fetches all recent plays in the top 10 plays for every user.
If the bot finds such a play, the play is converted to an embed and sent in a dedicated announcment channel in a dedicated private Discord server.
