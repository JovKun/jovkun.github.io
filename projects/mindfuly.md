This application was developed for CMPT 276.

We were separated into teams, with each team given the task to create any web application or web game that we wanted.
Using the YouTube API and OpenWeatherMap API, we were able to develop a new API that logs mood and energy, converting them into data that can be expressed in graphs or suggested as insights.
The URL for this application will come out soon, as we are planning a live deployment as per the course requirements.
