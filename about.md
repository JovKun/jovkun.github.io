## About Me

Hello, I'm currently a student at Simon Fraser University, studying Computing Science.

I got interested in coding when I was just a wee lad...
At the time, the videos on YouTube that kept popping up on my recommended were visualizations of sorting algorithms, and as a kid, they were amazingly satisfying and calming to watch. For a certain era in my life, that was all I watched. I would learn names of sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and many more (my favourite one was Bogosort, mainly because I was humoured by the name and that it was funny watching 10 bars get randomized every second). But then, I had a thought: how do these algorithms actually work? So I decided I wanted to replicate these algorithms by coding them myself. I took the first coding application I saw (which was p5.js, believe it or not), and what I saw fascinated me. How can such simple commands complete a massive task that a human would take weeks, if not months, to do?
So I went and coded. I implemented sort after sort, and as the complexity rose, the fascination rose as well. I implemented Gnome Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Comb Sort. And once I finished each sort, I would hook them up to a visualizer that I also made myself. Then I would watch them all day. And I mean, all day. I would watch them in class, at home, in bed, all day. And thus this silly little sorting adventure has come to a close, but my passion for programming was far from over. (If you are curious, here is the [sketch of the sorting algorithms](https://editor.p5js.org/joviankuntjoro2/sketches/VC9iwePLK))

I took online coding courses, such as Harvard's CS50, which accelerated my knowledge of coding even further. I even took the CCC from Waterloo when I was in 11th - 12th grade, and I achieved the Honour Roll (top 25%) twice! (In 2023, I actually scored a whopping 74/75, losing one mark due to a small bug in my solution.) I attended the Canadian CanSat competition, where I coded C++ for a satellite in the shape of a soda can and it is also where our team won the Team Perseverance Award (well, I won it. The rest of the team was at Disneyland). I even went as far as coding a personal project, which I called [ServerTopPlays](https://github.com/JovKun/ServerTopPlays). (Yes, I know, a weird name, but I was in grade 12. Let me be.)

Now, here I am. Currently taking CS at SFU, hoping to further my knowledge in programming and, most importantly, have a grand ol' time. I hope that this story can inspire some new minds to pick up programming, and that we can all have a grand ol' time together. :)
